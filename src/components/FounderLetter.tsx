        When we first found this land in the Central Highlands, it felt like discovering a secret that nature had been keeping just for us. The morning mist would roll through the coffee plantations, and we knew immediately that this was where our story would begin.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        Our farmstay started as a simple dream: to share the peace we found here with others who were seeking something authentic. We wanted to create a place where the rush of modern life could slow down to the rhythm of the seasons, where guests could wake up to birdsong instead of traffic.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        Every room in our home has been thoughtfully prepared with this intention. We've kept the original wooden beams, added handwoven textiles from local artisans, and ensured that each window frames a view of either our garden or the rolling hills beyond. This isn't just accommodation—it's an invitation into our daily life.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        Our farm produces much of what graces your breakfast table. The coffee beans are roasted weekly, the fruits are picked fresh each morning, and the vegetables come straight from our garden beds. We believe that every meal should tell the story of the land it comes from.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        We've also started something we call our "tree adoption program." Guests can sponsor one of our fruit trees and receive updates throughout the year about their tree's growth, flowering, and harvest. It's our way of keeping the connection alive long after you've returned home.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        What brings us the most joy is watching our guests slow down. We see them notice things they might have missed in their busy lives—the way light filters through leaves, the sound of rain on our tin roof, the satisfaction of harvesting vegetables for dinner with their own hands.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        This place has taught us that luxury isn't about having more things; it's about having more time. Time to breathe deeply, to taste your food, to have conversations that matter, to sleep deeply under stars you can actually see.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        We hope that when you visit us, you'll feel not like a tourist, but like a friend who's come to stay for a while. Because that's exactly what you are.
      </p>
